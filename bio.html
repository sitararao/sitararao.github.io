        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>My name is Sitara Rao and I am a student at Tufts University in Medford, MA. I am in the class of 2020 and majoring in Biology, with the intent of studying medicine after I graduate.</p>

        <p>I am from Andover, MA. Academically, I am passionate about biology research. More recently I have found that I really enjoy programming as well, which is why I am considering minoring in computer science.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing squash, running, drawing, taking photos, and spending time with my family and friends. </p>
